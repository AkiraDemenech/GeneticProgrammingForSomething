# GeneticProgrammingForSomething as TryMathGP
This can be a Genetic Programming application, but now (when I wrote this || self) it isn't complete enough to transcend the simple genetic operators.

I'm sorry if you expect that it was more completed, it has problems in evolution yet and other functions must be implemented.
The fitness number still strange (and unfortunately it isn't a number set or a Python type, so the Math happens strangelly).
I even tried to comment everything but when the bugs commed it become hard, I am sorry, I am so sorry.

The [Python](https://github.com/AkiraDemenech/GeneticProgrammingForSomething/tree/master/trymathgp) test version (this) you can install:
https://test.pypi.org/project/trymathgp/

The Original Java Version wasn't perfect too....
